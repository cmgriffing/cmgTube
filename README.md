## Usage
1. Open OBS

    - If it's under 27 (26 or lower), you need to update OBS
    - If it's 27, close OBS and install the [OBS Websocket Plugin](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/releases)
    - If it's over 27 (28 or higher), you can skip this step
2. Visit the [PNGTube Setup Page](https://sugoidogo.github.io/pngtube2/v6/), which will walk you through the rest.
