## OBS Python Module
OBS supports loading Python scripts as plugins, but this requires some setup.
You can use [this installer](https://github.com/sugoidogo/obs-python-installer) to quickly get it set up.
Once that's done, you can add `pngtube.py` to the scripts in `OBS > Tools > Scripts > Loaded Scripts` and pngtube will open and close automatically with obs.
