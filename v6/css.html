<div>In this repo there are a few basic css files you can use as starting points.</div>
<div>PNGTube uses the name of each image for its id (the # items in css) and applies the 'active' class (the . items in css) when audio is detected.</div>
<div>You can replicate this behavior in the test links by clicking on the window to toggle the active class.</div>
